# for csharp_style_ocre_* settings, the following conventions are followed during parsing:
# For array-type (sort-order) settings:
# 1. parsed left-to-right.
# 2. comma-separated
# 3. white space and '_' characters are removed during parsing, e.g. "member_kind" == "member kind" == "memberkind"
# 4. case-insensitive
# 5. Duplicates are ignored (first instance wins)
# 6. Missing value behavior is controlled by the csharp_style_ocre_add_missing_order_values setting.
